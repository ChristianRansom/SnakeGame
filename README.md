# SnakeGame
A classic game of Snake written in python

This is the first project I've written in python. I've been working mainly with Java for the past 5 years, so I'm pretty new to python conventions and the pythonic way of doing things. I hope by the time I'm done with this project I'll be pretty familiar with how things work in python. 

In the future I plan to study Deep Q Learning and implement an AI that will learn how to play this game.
