# SnakeGame
A classic game of Snake written in python

This is the first project I've written in python. I've been working mainly with Java for the past 5 years, so I'm pretty new to python conventions and the pythonic way of doing things. I hope by the time I'm done with this project I'll be pretty familiar with how things work in python.

Using the console 
Navigate into folder containing the main.py file
